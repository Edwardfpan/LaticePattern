# Put N blocks into a lattice of N x N such that neighbouring rows or columns should have 
# at least a pair of blocks that share an edge or a vertex. Two arrangements are considered 
# the same if they turn into each other by rotating or if they are mirror or each other. 
# This a program to print out total number of allowable arrangements for a particular 
# number N, and print out all the allowable arrangements with each block represented by a ‘#’.
